                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was done with a team at <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/scout/">
                        Northeastern's student led design studio: Scout</a>! In this project my team helped Wunderite,
                    an insurance management software, with branding and UX design.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
                <p>Before starting with any sort of design, we wanted to make sure we knew what the client
                    wanted or expected. This included questions like:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What makes Wunderite different from other software?</li>
                        <li>Who would be using Wunderite? Is it a consumer facing software or is it for businesses?
                            Could it be used by both?
                        </li>
                        <li>Why would someone need to use this software?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The final deliverable for the client was a full site redesign with designs given as Sketch files,
                    a site developed with a front and backend, and a brand book for future print materials.<br>
                </p>

            <div class="ctb__text ctb__text--long ">
                <h3>User Personas and Research</h3>
                <p>Before diving into wireframes and designs, we decided to focus on who the users of the platform
                    would be. We came up with a list of users that the software could possibly be for and presented
                    it to the client.
                </p>

            <img src="../assets/project-images/scout/user-stories_v1-2.jpg" style="object-fit: contain;">
        </div>

        <div class="large-image-section">
            <div class="ctb__text ctb__text--long ">
                <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                <p>We had two sets of wireframes, with two different types each. We built a set of wireframes
                    that would be insurance broker facing and one that would be insurance client facing. For each
                    user type, we made a set of lofi and hifi wireframes.
                    <br><br>
                    In making the lofi wireframes, we would regularly consult with the client about what a broker would
                    want in platform like this. What would be convenient to have or that this broker would use
                    regularly?
                    In these wireframes, we wanted to make sure the functionality was there before the actual designs.

                    <br><br>So for example, a lofi wireframe would look like this: (click image to expand)
                </p>
            </div>
            <a data-fancybox="images" href="../assets/project-images/scout/broker-dash-lofi.png">
                <img src="../assets/project-images/scout/broker-dash-lofi.png"
                    style="object-fit:cover; width: 660px; border: solid 1px black; object-position: 0 0;">
            </a>
            <div class="ctb__text ctb__text--long ">
                <p>In this wireframe, we're showing what a broker would see on first login. We wanted to make
                    sure that the broker would see the most important information at the top. This would
                    include the clients that have deadlines coming up soon.
                    <br><br>
                    Next, the user would have a few actions they would use regularly, like see all of their
                    clients, create a new risk profile, or file a new claim for their client.
                    <br><br>
                    And at the bottom of the dashboard, the broker would be able to find clients that
                    have they have worked on recently. That way, the broker wouldn't have to go through
                    the entire list of of clients every time.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="large-image-section">
            <div class="ctb__text ctb__text--long ">
                <h3>Designing</h3>
                <p>
                    After wireframing all the functionality in the site, we fleshed out designs for each
                    lofi wireframe. In this stage, we gave a branding voice and color to the site.
                    <br><br> So for example, the same broker dashboard page shown above would look something like this:
                </p>

                <a data-fancybox="images" href="../assets/project-images/scout/broker-dash-hifi.png">
                    <img src="../assets/project-images/scout/broker-dash-hifi.png"
                        style="object-fit:cover; width: 660px; border: solid 1px black; object-position: 0 0;">
                </a>
            </div>
            <div class="ctb__text ctb__text--long ">
                <p>As you can see, some of the elements were shifted around. This was a result of
                    the feedback from the client and other members in the team.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="centered-text-block">
                <div class=" ctb__text ctb__text--long ">
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        There were many, many more wireframes and designs that were made for this client. The 
                        project was a great exercise in UX design and things to consider when redesigning a site.
                        On top of learning more about UX, it was really informative learning about business insurance,
                        in terms of how it differs from personal insurance and how insurance brokers and clients
                        communicate with each other.
